## Professional Self-Assessment

My time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has assisted in shaping my professional goals and values. It has prepared me to become an asset to prospective employers. This ePortfolio shows my ability to plan and develop industry-standard code and software programs across **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms & Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

- Team collaboration and communication with stakeholders  
- Secure coding practices and threat awareness  
- Design trade-offs (performance vs. clarity) and testing strategies

## Course Outcomes Mapping

`Course Outcome 1` — Building collaborative environments for decision-making  
- Met via **code review** before enhancements and artifact planning.

`Course Outcome 2` — Professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications  
- Met via **CS360 (Software Design & Engineering)**: clear UI/UX and documentation.

`Course Outcome 3` — Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles  
- Met via **CS340 (Algorithms & Data Structures)**: improved efficiency and data handling.

`Course Outcome 4` — Use innovative techniques, skills, and tools to deliver value  
- Met via **CS360** and **CS340**: full-stack changes, client/server improvements, CI/testing.

`Course Outcome 5` — Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits  
- Met via **IT145 (Databases)**: validation, parameterized queries, and safe data handling.
